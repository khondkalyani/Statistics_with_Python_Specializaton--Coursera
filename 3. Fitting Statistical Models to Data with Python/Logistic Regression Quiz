Question 1
Imagine that you are collecting variables while participants attempted to shoot a soccer ball.  Which of the following collected variables could be predicted using 
a logistic regression model?
Scoring a soccer goal on a given shot
Whether a shot on goal traveled more than 20 feet
Sex (male vs. female)

Question 3
Two probabilities have been transformed using the logit function.  The two values after transformation are -2 and 0.25.  Which of the two values corresponds to a 
higher original probability?
0.25

Question 4
NHANES records whether an individual has smoked 100 cigarettes or more.  The next few questions will focus on fitting models to predict whether someone has 
smoked 100+ cigarettes.
First, a model is fit using body mass index (BMI) as the variable to predict smoking status.  The output is here:
What does the coefficient of 0.0037 mean?
For each increase in one in BMI, the log odds of smoking 100 cigarettes increases by about 0.0037, on average.

Question 5
Next, a model is fit adding Age as an additional covariate to BMI as the variables predicting smoking status.  The output is here:
What does the coefficient of 0.0169 mean in context?
For each increase of one in Age, the log odds of smoking 100 cigarettes increases by about 0.0169 while holding BMI constant, on average.

Question 6
Based on the logistic regression with both Age and BMI as covariates, are the coefficients statistically significant at a two-sided 10% significance level?
Only the coefficient for Age is significant

Question 7
The 95% confidence interval for the coefficient for Age is given above as (0.014, 0.020).  If instead we wanted a 90% confidence interval, how would the width
of the interval change?
It would be narrower

Question 8
We’d like to predict the log odds of smoking 100+ cigarettes for a given individual using the logistic regression model with the two variables: BMI and Age. 
For an individual with a BMI of 22 who is 45 years old, what would the predicted log odds be?
-0.417

Question 9
The sample of adults surveyed in NHANES contains adults age 20-80 with BMIs of 14.5-64.6.  For the individual with a BMI of 22 who is 45 years old, do you 
trust the predicted log odds calculated above as being reasonable?
Yes, this is interpolation

Question 10
Fill in the blanks.  With 95% confidence, I estimate that the increase in log odds of smoking 100+ cigarettes for each increase by one in BMI, while holding Age
constant, is between ____ and ____, on average.
-0.005 and 0.011
