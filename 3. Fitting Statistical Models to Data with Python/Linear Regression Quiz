b

Question 2
Which of the following scatterplot(s) would have a correlation coefficient that is close to 0? (Select all that apply.)
c
d
e

Question 3
Which of the following scatterplots would have the highest absolute correlation (i.e. shows the strongest linear relationship?)
d

Question 4
What distribution do the true errors need to follow in order to perform various inference procedures in linear regression?
True errors must be N(0, σ2)

Question 5
Which of the following are assumptions needed for conducting a hypothesis test on the population slope in a linear regression analysis? (Select all that apply.)
True errors must be normally distributed.
True errors have constant variance.
The population relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable is in fact linear.

Question 6
A study was conducted to model the linear relationship between Las Vegas nightly hotel cost (dollars) and hotel rating (on a 100 point scale).
Nightly hotel cost will be used to predict hotel rating. A random sample of 30 Las Vegas hotels was collected and an estimated slope (b1) was found to be 0.21. 
Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the estimated slope (b1)?
The hotel rating is estimated to increase by 0.21 points for every additional dollar spent on nightly hotel cost, on average.

Question 7
Background for Questions 7 - 13
In 1905, R.J. Gladstone conducted a study of the relationship between brain weight and size of the head. Brain weight (grams) and head size (cubic cm) measurements 
were performed for 237 adults. Two categorical variables for Sex (0=male, 1=female) and Age (0=young, 20-46 years old, 1=old, 46+ years old) are available. 
The linear regression results for regressing brain weight on the head size are summarized below.
One subject in the study has a head size of 3500 cm3 and a brain weight of 1430.86 grams. What is the value of the observed error (residual) for this subject?
183.3 grams  

Question 8
The study relating brain weight (grams) and head size (cubic cm) yielded an R-squared of 0.6393. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the 
R-squared?
63.93% of the variation in brain weight can be accounted for by the linear relationship with head size.

Question 9
What is the appropriate p-value for testing if there is a significant positive linear relationship between brain weight and head size?
<1e-16

Question 10
A 95% confidence interval for the mean brain weight for all adults in 1905 with a head size of 3400 cm3 was calculated to be (1210.14 grams, 1232.33 grams). 
How would the width of the 95% prediction interval for the brain weight for an individual adult in 1905 with a head size of 3400 cm3 compare to this one?
Wider

Question 11
A 95% confidence interval for the mean brain weight for all adults in 1905 with a head size of 3400 cm3 was calculated to be (1210.14 grams, 1232.33 grams).
How would the width of the 95% confidence interval for the mean brain weight for all adults in 1905 with a head size of 3600 cm3 compare to this one?
Narrower

Question 12
The head size of an 8 year old child is found to be 1800 cm3, What caution(s) should be noted if asked to predict this child’s brain weight? 
(Select all that apply.)
Extrapolation - A head size of 1800 cm3 is outside the range of our data.
Extrapolation - The model was created using only data for adults, not children.

13.
Question 13
A new model was fit, this time adding in the two categorical variables Sex (0=male, 1=female) and Age (0=young, 20-46 years old, 1= old, 46+ years old),
the model summary is shown below.
Which of the following is an appropriate interpretation of the estimated coefficient for age of -23.97 in the above table? 
Keeping head size and sex constant, the average brain weight for older subjects is estimated to be 23.97 grams less than the average brain weight for 
younger adults.
